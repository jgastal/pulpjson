 * @brief Class that encapsulates a JSON value.
 *
 * @warning There is no public constructor, the only way to get an instance of Value is through @ref Parser.
 *
 * The use of this class is fairly straight forward process, this shows a function that prints a value(recursively):
 * @code
 * //v must be a *Value instance gotten from Parser
 * void print_value(Value v)
 * {
 * 	switch(v.getType())
 * 	{
 * 		case Value::INT:
 * 			std::cout << "v is of type int and has value " << v.asInt() << "!\n";
 * 			break;
 * 		case Value::DOUBLE:
 * 			std::cout << "v is of type double and has value " << v.asDouble() << "!\n";
 * 			break;
 * 		case Value::STRING:
 * 			std::cout << "v is of type string and has value " << v.asString() << "!\n";
 * 			break;
 * 		case Value::BOOL:
 * 			std::cout << "v is of type bool and has value " << v.asBool() << "!\n";
 * 			break;
 * 		case Value::VECTOR:
 * 			std::cout << "v is of type vector and has value: \n";
 * 			for(int i = 0; i < v.asVector().size(); i++)
 * 				print_value(v.asVector()[i]);
 * 			break;
 * 		case Value::OBJECT:
 * 			std::cout << "v is of type object and has value: \n";
 * 			for(Object::iterator it = v.asObject().begin(); it != v.asObject().end(); it++)
 * 				print_value((*it).second);
 * 	}
